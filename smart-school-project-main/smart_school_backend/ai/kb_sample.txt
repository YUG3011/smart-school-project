Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy.
It occurs in chloroplasts using chlorophyll and produces oxygen as a byproduct.
The chemical energy produced is stored as glucose, which plants use for growth and metabolism.
Sunlight provides the energy, carbon dioxide provides the carbon, and water provides electrons and protons.
